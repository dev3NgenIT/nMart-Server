Problem:
	. After delete only shows 4 items, but on page refresh shows all users
			- Problem: fixed filters






-------------





frontend: missing
	. show alert on delete and error
	. send value on isVisible

	. some notification not works
	. select next categories based on previous category


backend: problem
	- Every route which has startDate and endDate there need to expire check in verifications, like
			- coupon expire checked needed in backend

	- substract product.stock after order completed
	- delete all reviews of specific product, when that product deleted
	- take a minimum copy of all fields within that collection too  which has reference. so that referenced item deletion not effect others



Problem-1: Update product from UI thow global error, means updateProduct controller didn't handled properly.
	Reason: ?
	Solution: ?

Problem: on update deleted all images, even it not changed in UI 
	Reason: Because on update send unchanged data too.
	solution:
		1. Don't send those data which not changed by UI ( need little work from UI)
		2. Update Backend: if url start's with http/https that means it image field not changed, 





ApiFeatures
	. ?_fields[name]=value 				

	Problem:
		1. Exact match: lowercase not allowed
		2. Exact match: part of work not allowed
	
	Solution:
		1. use _search for search, not _filter which is exact match.
		2. try to use `$res` operator if possible, so that it matches all citeria.

		Status
			- Full File 			:	200
			- Partial Content :	206


Full File Download
	- Clients (e.g., browsers, download managers) request the entire file by sending a GET request without a Range header.


			GET /upload/sample.mp4 HTTP/1.1
			Host: example.com




Partial Content (Streaming)
	- For large files (e.g., videos), clients request specific byte ranges using the Range header. This is often done by:

    - Media players (e.g., VLC, HTML5 video elements).
    - Download managers for resuming downloads.


			GET /upload/sample.mp4 HTTP/1.1
			Host: example.com
			Range: bytes=500-1000
